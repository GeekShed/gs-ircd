- Fix version string in configure.ac.

[2011-12-20] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (28edb1b2ffa3):
- Include CMDS=STARTTLS in ISUPPORT/numeric 005 to let clients discover STARTTLS support through VERSION, before or after registration (#4064).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6aa52251204d):
- Added patch from nenotopia to use more modern LUSERS numerics (#3967).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7eb7dac8c6c2):
- Fix small error in oper block documentation, reported by Stealth (#2318).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2ac124b6017f):
- Config parser failed to check for invalid set::ssl options, reported and patch by fbi (#4035).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (828bc1252f57):
- Tweak: send actual channel name and not user supplied channel in KICK, reported and patch by Stealth (#3298).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (1fa178948bcb):
- Services coders: Added support for ESVID. Instead of a number you can
  now store a string (of max NICKLEN size) as service stamp. See
  protoctl.txt and serverprotocol.html in doc/technical for more
  information.
  Patch from nenotopia (#3966).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (87475a4dc87a):
- Show account name in /WHOIS, for ESVID-capable services packages, patch from nenotopia (#3966).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (28cb99e59cc5):
- Added extended ban ~a:<account name> which matches users who are logged
  in to services with that account name. This works only on services that
  support ESVID. Patch from nenotopia (#3966).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (1fce7db4afc5):
- Updated extended ban documentation in help.conf and unreal32docs:
  new bantype ~a, and some text about extended bans & invex (+I).

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (103f3fa3235c):
- compile fix for just-checked-in patches.

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e6a2c2129590):
- extban ~a = also allowed for invex

[2011-12-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (46f02ee7e5f3):
- Throw up an error if a password in the configuration file is too long
  (max 48 characters), reported by JasonTik, based on patch from
  WolfSage (#3223).

[2011-12-26] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (4d9121e62893):
- Enforce matching of unrealircd version and PACKAGE_VERSION macros (#4014).

Now the UNREAL_VERSION_GENERATION, UNREAL_VERSION_MAJOR,
UNREAL_VERSION_MINOR, and UNREAL_VERSION_SUFFIX macros are
autogenerated from PACKAGE_VERSION.

[2011-12-28] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (4c91b9931dc3):
- Make default service stamp 0 (zero) again, instead of '*' which was
  introduced by ESVID changes a few days ago. This makes anope happy,
  and also means nothing will change in a non-ESVID scenario.

[2011-12-28] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (fef02a44abe7):
- heh ;)

[2012-01-02] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (79158ef9417c):
- Fix misuse of stdarg.h macros when calling vsyslog() (#4065 by Jimini).

[2012-01-02] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6518968ca480):
- Ditch vsyslog() as it's only a waste of CPU, inspired by #4065.

[2012-01-03] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (baf498e5e970):
- Run ./autogen.sh per 6518968ca480.

[2012-01-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (39c2196a29d7):
- Add CAP support. Currently implemented are: multi-prefix (NAMESX), and
  userhost-in-names (UHNAMES). Patch from nenotopia (#4018, #4066)

[2012-01-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (c50f12f4f3e1):
- Fix issue with CAP & NOSPOOF. Patch from nenolod (#4077).

[2012-01-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7c93a1efea50):
- Advertise 'tls' (STARTTLS) capability in CAP. Patch from nenolod (#4081).

[2012-01-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (1a0842b10cd0):
- New user mode +I (IRCOp only) which hides idle times to other users,
  suggested and patch supplied by Nath & binki (#3953).

[2012-01-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (58c35ea52a1f):
- Added remove_oper_modes(), which works just like remove_oper_snomasks(),
  and ensures that the user does not have any ircop-only user modes after
  de-opering. This (only) fixes the just added +I umode case, but could
  also prevent future bugs.

[2012-01-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (d66fa5f585df):
- Get rid of networks/ directory, and all references to it. Suggested by
  katsklaw and others (#4056).

[2012-02-08] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7a9c8ef652c1):
- Donators

[2012-02-08] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (8f06f534bdf2):
- Added doc/example.es.conf, translated by Severus_Snape.

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (3d09d7c54790):
- Make the accept code check if the fd is within bounds instead of relying
  on OpenFiles to be correct. This fixes a crash when f.e. 3rd party modules
  have files open but don't increase OpenFiles. Might also fix a curl crash,
  though nobody ever reported one.

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (475ef9dc97a0):
- Moved nospoof to config file, suggested by and patch from nenolod (#4078).
  This means ping cookies are now controlled by set::ping-cookie [yes|no].
  The default is 'yes' (enabled).

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f4767d3fcba4):
- Even when 'M' was listed in set::oper-only-stats you could still do a
  '/STATS m'. Unlike other stats characters, case insensitivity was not
  checked for this one. Reported by and patch from Apocalypse (#4086).

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (869790963c0f):
- Added patch from Adam for poll() support (#1245).

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (eb03f48654b8):
- regarding poll patch:
* move all (re-)initalization to reset_pollfd(), i'm
much more comfortable with that as it aids debugging a lot.
* add parenthesis.

update my own fd check code for poll support

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (413d6273818c):
- Some more changes and fixes regarding poll patch:
* use get_client_by_pollfd() function instead of pollfd_to_client[]
  directly, so we can easily find and debug any mistakes.
* add some commenting
* add extra debugging and core dumping if fd or slot values are out of bounds
* fix race condition in read_authports() where send_authports() 2 lines up
  could have closed the socket, resulting in a read from fd -1.
  NOTE: I've updated the select (non-poll) code as well, should be harmless.

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (699cb7949b7a):
- make c-ares use 100% poll. and make sure we never deal with negative fds.

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f1f6c992c228):
- changelog entry for all previous commits:
- UnrealIRCd now supports poll() instead of select().
  There are some minor speed benefits if you have more than 1K or 2K
  clients, however the main noticeable difference is that on Linux you can
  now easily enter a higher maximum connection count than 1024 in ./Config,
  without having to edit system header files.
  Of course, you still need to be allowed to use the # of sockets (type
  'ulimit -n' on the shell).
  Support for this is experimental at this stage, but enabled by default
  so it can receive all the testing it deserves. If all goes well, it will
  be the default for 3.2.10.
  Stress testing is very much welcomed!

[2012-02-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a41fdf31a5da):
- last change to poll patch for the day.. fixing my own fix ;)

[2012-02-27] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (3926b20bf420):
- Speed optimization: First, moved a large part of vsendto_prefix_one into
  vmakebuf_local_withprefix. Then use this new function - which creates the
  buffer-to-be-sent - at the top of functions like sendto_channel_butserv
  and sendto_common_channels and send the prepared buffer in the loop that
  comes after it. This means we only prepare the buffer once and then send
  it many times, rather than both building and sending it XYZ times.
  Benchmarking connect-join-quit of 10k clients:
  100 users per channel: no noticeable speed improvement
  1000 users per channel: 18% faster
  10000 users in one channel: 50% faster
  As you can see, unfortunately, for a typical irc network there isn't much
  speed improvement. However, if you have a couple of 500+ user channels or
  get attacked by clones then you may see some improvement in speed and/or lower
  CPU usage.

[2012-03-01] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (0381648f5616):
- Minor documentation typos, thanks warg (#4094).

[2012-03-01] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (ff9c3863f074):
- Minor documentation typos, thanks warg (#4094).

[2012-03-01] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (09b3de19c203):
- merge

[2012-03-06] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (b60e98d7b61e):
- Call m_cap_Init() when m_cap is loaded through commands.so. Reported by nenolod.

[2012-03-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (954bd24668fa):
- Fix for speed optimization a few lines up, was accidentally using ident
  username (which might have been 'unknown') instead of effective username.

[2012-03-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (db9bd1f1d7f2):
- Added support for SASL, patch from nenolod (#4079).

[2012-03-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (08d166a75cd0):
- Some really minor SASL tweaks

[2012-03-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (c2adaa2861ec):
- Fix crash in AUTHENTICATE (SASL commit from an hour or so ago).

[2012-03-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (1f34825404a1):
- Tweak SASL code to conform to current coding style.

[2012-03-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f07846413bb2):
- Some more SASL fixes

[2012-03-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ebb36eee0aa6):
- Some more SASL fixes, and more...

[2012-03-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (4445301fdd62):
- Split up PROTOCTL line, since with the addition of ESVID we exceeded
  MAXPARA when using ZIP links.
  This caused an odd charset warning upon link.

[2012-03-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (13d4a17d08e2):
- Poll I/O engine: get_client_by_pollfd() may return -1 when there's a race
  condition. Don't abort, instead just skip those clients.
  This fixes a crash I had on /SQUIT.

[2012-03-30] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (00e9422c700d):
- Fix win32 installer: apparently it sometimes complained about not having
- the Visual C++ 2008 redistributable package installed when this was not true.

[2012-03-29] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (c6acccaf5d1a):
- Fix Windows build.

[2012-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2e767168cd58):
- Win32 compile fix (nenolod)

[2012-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (62de808a64c3):
- Print out a warning when we can't write to a log file. When booting this
  goes to the boot screen. When we are already booted it's sent to all
  IRCOps with a limit of max. 1 message per 5 minutes.
- Refuse to boot when we can't write to any log file.

[2012-04-09] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (5bb0fb828a9a):
- Remove old no-stealth configuration directive from documentation,
  reported by katsklaw, patch from warg (#4036).

[2012-04-09] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (10830f9bd8ed):
- Added 'away-notify' client capability, which informs the client of any AWAY state changes of users on the same channel. Patch from nenolod (#4097).

[2012-04-09] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (5567e115818e):
- Add support for account-notify client capability (#4098). This capability
  can be used to request passive notifications for accountname changes.

[2012-04-09] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (940c09f39f76):
- If set::options::dont-resolve is enabled, then use only the IP information
  from a WEBIRC message, reported by Ismat (#4103).

[2012-04-28] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (402025294e53):
- Update donators

[2012-05-01] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ac7de84b6fe6):
- Moved sendto_connectnotice, and thus the call to HOOKTYPE_LOCAL_CONNECT,
  so it gets called after the broadcast of NICK to other servers.

[2012-05-02] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f892b237c7a3):
- Fix bug caused by new I/O engine (both with and without USE_POLL):
  queued data on the receive queue (eg: due to fake lag) was not processed
  unless we got new data from the client.
  Now, better document this. Also, avoid calling dbuf_put with 0 length.

[2012-05-04] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (a4058e167586):
- Add support for server-enforced mode locks (MLOCK).
  This allows the IRCd to enforce MLOCKs that are set by services, which
  eliminates clashes between users setting modes and services enforcing
  it's mlock on channels. (#3055)

[2012-05-04] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7788ade137c0):
- complete the previous patch (MLOCK).. mostly just bringing it up to date & code-style

[2012-05-07] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (766727e05118):
- Fixed another SASL crash bug. Always use HookAddEx, not HookAdd!
  Crash occured after the first quit of a user after a REHASH.
  Reported by Dave (#4108).

[2012-05-07] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (8db85bd24b93):
- SASL now needs to be enabled explicitly by setting a set::sasl-server.
  If this is not set, then SASL is off and not advertised.
  If the specified server is not connected, then SASL is off as well.
  This prevents unnecessary delay (and the inability for some clients to
  get online) when SASL is not in use or when the SASL server is down.

[2012-05-07] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (99377f34c7e0):
- Changed numeric 307 (RPL_WHOISREGNICK) to 'is identified for this nick',
  reported by fbi (#3399).

[2012-06-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (b63fddf45fc4):
- Win32 installer (SSL): Uncheck 'create certificate' checkbox when
  server.cert.pem exists, and check it if the file doesn't exist.
  You can still change the setting, just the default is correct now.
  The code for this was already there but was not working correctly
  causing users to go through the generation process upon each install.

[2012-06-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (24281ae09d95):
- Win32 installer: Latest InnoSetup no longer supports Windows 95/98,
  so update Minversion to make the .iss compile.

[2012-07-10] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (b58dffedc831):
- Module coders: added HOOKTYPE_AWAY (sptr, away-reason).

[2011-07-13] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (7d0e77e30087):
- Add optional oper::require-modes setting to the oper block. (#4008 by katsklaw)

Any attempt to /OPER by someone who doesn't have one of the listed
usermodes is rejected. This can be used to restrict oper blocks to
registered nicks (+r) or secure clients (SSL, +z).

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a6525074d8e2):
- Changes for #4008 patch.

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7576b3236ff5):
- Clarify that hiddenhost-prefix must be the same on linked servers for
  bans to function properly (#4090, patch from warg, reported in #4043
  by maxb).

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (0658fe34c951):
- Add /SILENCE to HTML documentation (reported by Severus_Snape in
  #4072, patch from warg).

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6ffa8616a5a7):
- Show "Ping timeout: XYZ seconds" instead of just "Ping timeout".
  Patch from darkex (#3960).

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (480e16958832):
- a bigger scratch buffer makes me sleep at night ;)

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ad28e19ce167):
- Install server.*.pem files, patch from katsklaw (#3988).
- The ./Config script will now ask whether to generate an SSL
  certificate when it does not exist (defaults to Yes), instead of
  always generating one.

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (69a5c751a677):
- Added missing Mod_Header to m_sasl.c

[2012-08-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a4f4c0575991):
- Remove old reference to networks/ directory from Windows installer

[2012-10-06] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7ea018e931c4):
- Disable sending of UHNAMES when HTM (High Traffic Mode) is ON,
  suggested by driew (#3900).

[2012-10-06] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (96339a022355):
- Disable sending of UHNAMES when HTM (High Traffic Mode) is ON,
  suggested by driew (#3900).

[2012-10-06] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (3a1f9e484676):
- Add 'class' option to allow/deny channel so you can allow/deny
  users based on their class. Patch from fspijkerman (#4125).

[2012-10-14] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (32dca22d7deb):
- Use poll() in the remote includes functions when USE_POLL is
  defined (#4091).

[2012-10-14] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (db66aa54c26e):
- Fix bug where recursive includes would hang the IRCd, patch from
  binki with some minor modifications, reported by warg (#3919).

[2012-10-14] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (5cf5af0b41cd):
- Upgraded to c-ares 1.9.1. Updated configure & other files.

[2012-10-15] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (789a093eabec):
- various win32 fixes:
- Disable USE_POLL on Windows, since it doesn't work with XP and has
  no advantage anyway. Reported by nenolod (#4129).
- Various updates to makefile.win32 and .iss file, found during
  building new versions of zlib, openssl, and curl.

[2012-10-15] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2680c44b18fe):
- Added set::options::disable-cap, which can be used to disable the
  new CAP support (#4104).

[2012-10-15] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (64b3c4006702):
- Added auth method 'sslclientcertfp' which provides an alternative
  method to authenticate users with SSL client certificates based
  on SHA256 fingerprints. This can be used instead of the already
  existing 'sslclientcert' so you don't have to use an external file.
  One way to get the SHA256 fingerprint would be:
  openssl x509 -in name-of-pem-file.pem -sha256 -noout -fingerprint
  Suggested and patch supplied by Jobe (#4019).
- Added documentation on the new sslclientcertfp
- Moved documentation on authentication types to one place and refer
  to it from each section (oper::password, vhost::password,
  link::password-receive, etc).

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7263bbdde9a0):
- Windows: fix MOTD file always showing a date of 1/1/1970, reported
  by maxarturo (#4102).

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (59bd63d4ff41):
- Added release notes

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (9fc74a213639):
- Update version to 3.2.10-rc1

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f10e4dfce1d8):
- Bump version number in all translated docs as well (did not change
  the 'last update' date, though).

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (40e659bdebb9):
- Removed unreal32docs.es.html (outdated since 2006-12-22),
  unreal32docs.gr.html (outdated since 2006-12-02), and
  unreal32docs.nl.html (outdated since 2009-01-18, possibly 2007-07-12).
  These translations are out of date for many years and are causing
  problems for the people who are reading this out of date information.
  If you want to update these translations, or (maybe better) redo
  the translation of unreal32docs in these languages, then send an
  e-mail to syzop@unrealircd.com.
  Note that for all these languages we have had people in the past
  offering to help out, but in the end we never heard back from them,
  so please ONLY contact us if you: 1) are serious, and 2) have
  sufficient time available to work on this project.
  That said, users in your language will greatly appreciate your work!
  Of course, if you want to translate documents in any other language
  then you are welcome to contact us as well.

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (01bc8508426d):
- update e-mail address

- Remove wircd.def, needs to be re-generated almost each build anyway..

[2012-10-16] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2f07e55a148b):
- Added last donator before rc1

[2012-10-17] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (05ea29482ae7):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10rc1 for changeset 094646e391e6

[2012-11-04] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ef3aca597034):
- 3.2.10-rc1 release was on 2012-10-17 (public on 2012-10-18)

[2012-11-04] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (4bb832cf6710):

  agent. Fixes crash reported by Adam.

[2012-11-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (976aa357fc94):
- Argh.. silly Windows symbol crap.

[2012-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a2a96c43eb07):
- Import unreal32docs Spanish translation by Karim Benzema.

[2012-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (3786b24e9d07):
- Rename Changes.old to Changes.older
- Rename Changes to Changes.old
- In the Mercurial repository the Changes file no longer exists (except
  for a dummy file). You now need to run ./createchangelog to generate it.
  Of course in official releases the Changes file will be present and
  contain all details.
- From now on, the Changes file is based on the history of the Mercurial
  repository. This means we no longer have to write text manually to the
  Changes file. This simple change helps a lot in future development
  because patches will no longer break when they are being ported from
  one branch to another.

[2012-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (121fd0b71bc4):
- Update ./createchangelog to make it only show changes on default branch.

- Added tag unreal3_2_10 for changeset 7bf37138e074

[2012-12-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2e090557fdaa):
- If you are running the IRCd as root and use IRC_USER/IRC_GROUP then we now
change ownership of the log file to that user/group so it can still write
after the setuid(). Reported by asmadeus (#4152).

[2012-12-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f0c4b60ec111):
- Removed tag unreal3_2_10

[2012-12-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (374e62529d4c):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10 for changeset f0c4b60ec111

[2012-12-28] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (d9d5cc06d06d):
- Fix duplicate user@host in away-notify and account-notify, reported by grawity (#4153).

[2012-12-28] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (fe153e789040):

[2013-01-09] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (5ba6ced7e94f):

[2013-01-11] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6f401411763f):
- allow channel: Permit multiple channel items in one block again, was broken by patch from #4125.

[2013-01-27] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (3623cab602e7):
- Update the documentation about set::dns::nameserver to reflect reality (that the setting is only used if c-ares can’t read /etc/resolv.conf).

[2013-02-19] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (67300f8612ed):
- Don't remove oper-modes such as +S from non-local clients. Reported by
  Magiobiwan (#4166). This caused an issue with bots from anope BotServ
  where user modes +Sq were stripped by the IRCd.

[2013-01-14] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (1672141ba571):
- Pull in poll(2) stuff before any other ircd include files. (#4155)
  This allows us to successfully build on systems where pulling in poll.h
  pollutes the code with a broken form of ctypes.h due to a few reasons, not
  limited to, but including, usage of non-namespaced macros which clash with
  our own.

[2013-04-04] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (85f541d0a1e5):
- Windows: Fix strange linking bug. Outgoing connects from a Windows
  IRCd caused a garbled SERVER protocol message, causing 'cannot find
  server' errors and killing of users. Reported by Sunkat (#4183).

[2013-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (25922088089b):
- Custom modules: move EXLIBS= so shared libraries are always linked.
Reported by DE_Glen (#4182).

[2013-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (c3cb6a2bdf5b):
- Bump version to 3.2.10.1 & update release notes.

[2013-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (7c156b324a96):

- Bump version and update date in docs. Add Windows 7. Remove Windows 2000 as
it apparently no longer works (#4180).

[2013-04-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e64dcec0a656):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10_1 for changeset 0e7e08cf2b35

- Added tag unreal3_2_10_1 for changeset 15542aa9f0d2

[2013-05-10] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a033da33a60e):
- Fix strange issue where linking didn't work because UnrealIRCd would
bind to (for example) the loopback interface before connecting to the
remote server.
In addition to that, we now don't bind() at all when bind-ip is not
present or is set to "*".

[2013-05-10] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e63bf7596cda):
- This one is better, and actually compiles ;)

[2013-11-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6e141684dd40):
- Various fixes, more info later.

[2013-11-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f8e542d8defa):

[2013-11-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (493ba6a48557):
- autoconf

[2013-11-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (d4f65d4be09d):
- Windows installer: require Visual Studio 2012 Redist. package
Unfortunately we can no longer auto-download so we send the user
to a microsoft.com page when the package seems not installed.
Hopefully most users will have it installed though...

[2013-11-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (6ed4def5e40d):

- Update curl-ca-bundle with a more recent version

[2013-11-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (fb84a19dcccf):
- Update win32 version suffix

[2013-11-22] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (914db8ce9bd5):
- Update win32 installer

[2013-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (66a9bd22c28f):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10_2 for changeset 914db8ce9bd5

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (fab5b327da93):
- Removed tag unreal3_2_10_2

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (8bb3dab0adcf):
- When you use -D or -I in CFLAGS the bundled c-ares configure script
now no longer errors. Reported by QIXOZL (#4244). An attempt for a
more proper fix will be made later.

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (90da005ec35a):
- Fix for OS X so it can actually compile. Reported by QIXOZL (#4236).

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (bb9dc478e2db):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10_2 for changeset 90da005ec35a

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (33eb741e0d66):
- Removed tag unreal3_2_10_2

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ab013c6c5a79):

[2013-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a5a26ba9e626):
- Added tag unreal3_2_10_2 for changeset ab013c6c5a79

[2013-12-05] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (8533651cac02):
- Update .hgignore to cover more of autotools and support testing unrealircd by running it out of the repository directory directly.

[2013-12-05] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (c5ef6da4f4b5):
- Allow set::channel-command-prefix to be an empty string.

[2013-12-05] Nathan Phillip Brink <ohnobinki@ohnopublishing.net> (0330b0b3f486):
- Describe how channel mode +d (Deaf) still intentionally allows bot commands through, thanks Dan39.

[2013-11-25] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e7727c6f8564):
- Fix curlinstall script (updated c-ares version)

[2013-12-19] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (477094113ca2):
- added two donators

[2013-12-19] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (2a83d4586219):
- added two donators

[2014-01-09] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (399505ae224b):
- Secure server to server links were previously hardcoded at SSLv3. This has
been fixed to be 'SSLv3 or later'.  In practice this means that you will now
see a lot more server-to-server links using TLSv1.2.

[2014-01-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (05dcf4fd18ab):
- Fix compile problem on OS X 10.9, reported and patch provided by
JustinTArthur (#4251).

[2014-01-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a3d24860fff3):
- Fix possible SASL crash caused by remote server, reported by grawity
(#4219).

[2014-01-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a94a055923ed):
- For silenced users we will now only check the current nick!user@host,
suggested by Stevie (#2226).

[2014-01-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (17c8debe44d7):
- When you specified more than 4 servers in set::timesynch::server you could
experience weird issues such as a flood of 'Cannot accept connections:
invalid argument' messages. Reported by hyper_threader (#4242).

[2014-01-12] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e09d960ccc93):
- Added SVIDLEN so this value is now separate from NICKLEN. Previously if you
would lower NICKLEN to 9 then services timestamps would be cut off. Reported
by Jobe (#4248).

[2014-01-20] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (dfb1baf37097):
- Added set::spamfilter::stop-on-first-match [yes|no]:
By default this is set to 'yes' which means that once a spamfilter matches
UnrealIRCd will take action immediately and any additional (other)
spamfilters will not be processed.
When this is set to 'no' then after the first spamfilter match other
spamfilters will still be checked. All of these matches will be logged and a
message will go to IRCOps (snomask +S) for each one. The affected user,
however, will only see one spamfilter action (eg: block or kill) which will
be the spamfilter with the 'gravest action' (gzline is highest, block and
warn are lowest).

[2014-02-01] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (cf52d6a55d1d):
- Add donator

[2014-03-30] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a52da57c9366):
- Fix './unreal backtrace': on more recent gdb versions or in languages other
than English not always all tmp/*.so files were added. Therefore the
backtrace was often (much) less informative. We now use a different method.

[2014-05-30] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (3eab9c2baa85):
- Fix crash if SASL is enabled and ping-cookie is disabled (neither are the
default). Reported by fbi (#4307).

[2014-05-31] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (54abaf1fb873):
- Prepare for 3.2.10.3

[2014-05-31] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (b474a485c9ea):
- update version to .3

[2014-07-05] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (e25a31250723):
- For services who allow you to log in by account name but still allow you to
use a different nick: when you're logged in you are now considered
registered as far as channel mode +M (only registered users may speak and
+R (only registered users may join) are concerned. Same for user mode +R
(only allow private messages from registered users).
Tech: whenever services set SVID and it's not * and does not start with a
      number, then we consider this user to be 'logged in'.
      Whenever a user is set +r (s)he is also considered 'logged in'.
      This way it's compatible with both older and new services and doesn't
      introduce security issues with older services using servicetimestamp
      for nick tracking or other means.
This issue was reported by ShawnSmith (#4318).

[2014-07-06] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (1070c09c1dc2):
- Fix compile errors when building with clang instead of gcc, which is more
and more becoming the default nowadays such as on FreeBSD.
Reported by QIXOZL (#4239). Backported the patch from Heero.

[2014-07-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (52bbe71eb9f6):
- 3.2.10.4

[2014-07-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (f33ccaf7ef0b):
- Update curl-ca-bundle from Dec 29 20:03:40 2012 to Tue Jul 15 08:33:20 2014

[2014-07-26] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (ecb65d385bc9):
- report as 3.2.10.4 on windows
