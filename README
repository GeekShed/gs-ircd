==[ COMPILING ]==
To build the ircd, run:
./Config
make

If you specified an alternative location during ./Config you also need
to run "make install".

==[ MAKING A CONFIG FILE ]==
If you are new, then you need to create your own configfile:

copy doc/example.conf to your main UnrealIRCd directory and call
it unrealircd.conf .
Then open it in an editor and carefully modify it, consult the docs
(doc/unreal32docs.html, or online: www.unrealircd.com/unreal32docs.html)
for more information about every block/setting.
Common problems are explained in the FAQ, which is located at:
http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIrcd/faq/ .

==[ BOOTING YOUR IRCD ]==
Just type: ./unreal start
Note that after booting the errors are usually logged to ircd.log,
so check that file if you have any problems.
Again, check the FAQ (and docs) if you have any boot problems.
