Unreal3.2.10.3 Release Notes
=============================

==[ GENERAL INFORMATION ]==
- If you are upgrading on *NIX, then make sure you run 'make clean' and
  './Config' first, before running 'make'.
- The official UnrealIRCd documentation is doc/unreal32docs.html
  online version at: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIRCd/unreal32docs.html
  FAQ: http://www.vulnscan.org/UnrealIRCd/faq/
  Read them before asking for help.
- Report bugs at http://bugs.unrealircd.org/
- The purpose of the sections below (NEW, CHANGED, MINOR, etc) is to be a
  SUMMARY of the changes in this release. See the file 'Changes' for a
  complete list of all changes.

==[ .3 RELEASE ]==
The following issues have been fixed in 3.2.10.3:
- Crash when SASL is enabled and ping-cookie is disabled
- Compile issue with remote include
- OS X compile problems
- ./unreal backtrace not always working well
Changes:
- For silenced users we now only check the current nick!user@host
- Server to server links now use latest TLS (eg: v1.2) instead of SSLv3
New:
- Added set::spamfilter::stop-on-first-match (default yes). You can change
  this to 'no' to have UnrealIRCd continue processing all spamfilters even
  after the first match. The spamfilter with the 'gravest action' wins
  (eg: gzline wins from block).

==[ .2 RELEASE ]==
The following major issues were present in 3.2.10 & 3.2.10.1 and have
been fixed in this version:
- A remote crash issue when compiled with SSL (NULL pointer dereference)
- A second issue that can potentially lead to a crash (read-after-free)

In addition to these 3.2.10.x fixes there were also some other bugs fixed,
mostly in the area of server linking and flood hardening.

The external libraries of the Windows version have been updated (openssl,
c-ares, zlib). The bundled c-ares source (for *NIX) has been updated too.

==[ .1 RELEASE ]==
The following bugs in version 3.2.10 were fixed in this 3.2.10.1 release:
- Windows only: outgoing connects from Windows caused severe linking issues,
  including killing of (ghost) users on the Windows server.
- An issue where user modes were stripped from remote clients, this caused
  a problem for Anope BotServ bots.
- A compile problem on OpenBSD.
- '/REHASH -global' did not rehash all servers.
- Some documentation updates.

==[ 3.2.10 RELEASE ]==
Below is a summary of all changes with respect to 3.2.9:

==[ NEW ]==
- Improved socket engine. This brings some performance improvements and
  also makes it easier to configure a system to hold more than 1024
  clients (no more editing of header files on Linux!).
- ESVID support: services can communicate the account name of the user
  back to the IRCd. This only works on ESVID-capable services:
  - Extban ~a:<accountname>: matches users who are logged in to services
    with that account name.
  - Show account name in /WHOIS
- CAP support: this enables clients to enable certain features more easily.
  Can be disabled through set::options::disable-cap.
- Now that STARTTLS is advertised in CAP it is likely to be used more often.
- away-notify: informs clients of AWAY state changes of users on the same
  channels, for clients that support this.
- account-notify: similar to away-notify, inform clients of changes in the
  login status and account name used by other clients on the same channels.
- SASL support. To use this, and if your services support this, you point
  set::sasl-server to your services server.
- Server-side MLOCK support: the IRCd will prevent channel mode changes
  depending on the MLOCK setting in services. Requires special support
  from services for this feature.
- User Mode +I (IRCOp only): hide idle time
- auth-method 'sslclientcertfp': authenticate users using an SSL client
  certificate by the SHA256 fingerprint of that certificate.
  The documentation has a new section (3.19) called 'Authentication Types'
  which contains an (improved) example of how to use SSL client certificate
  authentication instead of regular passwords.
- oper::require-modes: an optional setting, which can be used to require
  users to have certain user modes (such as 'z') before they can /OPER up.
- allow/deny channel: you can now optionally specify a class here as an
  extra filter.
- doc/example.es.conf: Spanish translation of example configuration file.
- There have also been some behavior changes, which can be considered NEW,
  see next section (CHANGED).

==[ CHANGED ]==
- Anti-spoof protection (ping cookies) can now be enabled/disabled at
  run-time through set::ping-cookie [yes|no]. The default is 'yes' (enabled).
- A quit with 'Ping timeout' now shows the number of seconds since the ping.
- Print out a warning if we can't write to a log file.
- Refuse to boot if we can't write to ANY log file.
- Windows: if an SSL certificate exists, then uncheck the 'generate SSL
  certificate' checkbox by default.
- *NIX with SSL: We now ask in ./Config if you want to generate an SSL
  certificate. The certificate is then copied when you run 'make install'.

==[ MAJOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- Windows SSL crash (this issue was already fixed in 3.2.9-SSL-fix)
- Other than that, none?

==[ MINOR BUGS FIXED ]==
- Various compile problems, in particular with remote includes enabled.
- Windows: the installer sometimes insisted that the Visual C++ 2008
  redistributable package was not installed, when it actually was there.
- Windows: MOTD file date/time was always showing up as 1/1/1970.
- And more... see Changelog

==[ REMOVED / DROPPED ]==
- Windows 9X is no longer supported
- The networks/ directory has been removed

==[ KNOWN ISSUES ]==
- Regexes: Be careful with backreferences (\1, etc), certain regexes can
  slow the IRCd down considerably and even bring it to a near-halt.
  In the spamfilter user target it's usually safe though.
  Slow spamfilter detection can help prevent the slowdown/freeze, but
  might not work in worst-case scenario's.
- Regexes: Possessive quantifiers such as, for example, "++" (not to be
  confused with "+") are not safe to use, they can easily freeze the IRCd.

==[ ADDITIONAL INFO ]==
- See Changelog for more details
