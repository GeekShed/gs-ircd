| Congratulations on your new SSL self-signed certificate for your IRCd.  |
| However, wouldn't it be better that you get your certifcate signed by   |
| some kind of Certification Authority (CA), so your users can check that |
| they are really connected to the real server, so they feel secure?      |
|                                                                         |
| There is an initiative at CACert.org - They offer SSL Certificates      |
| for use with your IRCd for free, so your users can be sure that they    |
| can trust you and your server.                                          |
|                                                                         |
