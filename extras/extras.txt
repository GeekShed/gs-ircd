These are 3rd party programs modules, or unsupported modules.

Custom modules are compiled by copying them to src/modules
and running from the root directory

$ make custommodule MODULEFILE=modulename

This will produce a .so you can load. Upon load, this will show a "3" in the
/version flags, as it contains third party modules (we do not support if it
crashes because of the tainted module)
