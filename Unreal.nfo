 Development version
 ====================
 To access the latest development version of UnrealIRCd you need to use mercurial (hg).
 Note that because you are accessing a development version it may not compile, the
 server may crash, or other problems can occur since the code is likely to be only
 lightly tested (or not at all). On the other hand, using the development version may
 help you to get rid of that single nasty bug that is haunting you, plus if you test
 it and give us feedback (report bugs) then you actually help us with developing Unreal.

 The command to grab the development version is:
 hg clone http://hg.unrealircd.org/unreal

 If you get something like 'hg: command not found' then you need to install mercurial.
 Most *NIX systems have such a 'mercurial' package, but if you don't, or you are on
 Windows or Mac OS X, then see http://mercurial.selenic.com/
